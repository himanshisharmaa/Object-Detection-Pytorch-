# Object-Detection-Pytorch-
Object Detection with PyTorch using pre trained networks.
This project is to perform Object Detection using the following state-of-the-art classification networks:
- Faster RCNN with a ResNet50 backbone (more accurate,but slower)
- Faster RCNN with a MobileNet v3 backbone(faster, but less accurate)
- RetinaNet with a ResNEt50 backbone(good balance between speed and accuracy)
